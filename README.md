# CollageManagement
## **Collage Project**
A quiz app that manages both student and teacher side. 🧑‍🎓 👨‍🏫 👩‍🏫

### 👉  Concept
Student can login with their credentials and start attending the quiz that was created by their teacher of choice,
meanwhile teachers have the liberty to create as many quiz as they desire for their students to attend.

### 👉 Different UI for both party
Depending on the user they would be guided to their respective custom app UIs 🖥️  

### 👉 Login
Login for teacher and student would be the same, a default profile would be created for the logged in party 
and they would havw the liberty to change the information to their desire.

### 👉 Signup
New users can signup using their email and password or create an account using Google.

### 👉  Score Keeping
Scoring system would be set up soon 🔜 that would keep track of the student best and their past scores,
including showing the student with the most score in leader board of the respective teacher's quiz.
